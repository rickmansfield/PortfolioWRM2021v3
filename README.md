### ooohhh fun secret checkbox... try it out!
## Fun facts about this project You may use...Click the checkbox next to my name to see a second option for navigation.
 
The reason `Nav1.js` doesn't need `sectionRefs` and `scrollToSection` like `Nav2.js` is due to the way these two components handle navigation:


1. **`Nav1.js` uses anchor links (`<a href="#Projects">`)**:
   - Anchor links rely on the browserâ€™s built-in behavior to scroll to the target section of the page with matching `id` attributes.
   - For example, `<a href="#Projects">Projects</a>` will automatically scroll the page to the section with `id="Projects"` without needing any JavaScript to manage the scroll behavior.
   - The browser takes care of this by jumping directly to the target section when the user clicks the link.

2. **`Nav2.js` uses JavaScript with `scrollToSection()`**:
   - Instead of relying on anchor links, `Nav2.js` manually triggers the scrolling behavior using the `scrollToSection` function.
   - This approach allows more control over the scrolling (e.g., smooth scrolling) by programmatically calling `scrollToSection(sectionRef)` to scroll to the specific section.

### Why Both Work:
- **`Nav1.js`** is simpler because it uses the default behavior of anchor links, which automatically work as long as there are matching `id` attributes in the sections (e.g., `<div id="Projects">`).
- **`Nav2.js`** requires `scrollToSection` and `sectionRefs` because it doesn't rely on anchor links. Instead, it manually calls the scrolling logic using JavaScript, which allows more customization (e.g., smooth scrolling and handling events).

### When to Use Each Approach:
- **Anchor links (`Nav1.js`)**: Best for simple, default navigation behavior.
- **JavaScript-based scrolling (`Nav2.js`)**: Useful when you need more control over how and when scrolling happens (e.g., smooth scrolling or custom scroll behavior).
